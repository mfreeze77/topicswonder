        "# Auto Generated Agent Chat: Collaborative Task Solving with Coding and Planning Agent\n",
        "\n",
        "AutoGen offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool or human, which can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framwork allows tool use and human participance through multi-agent conversation.\n",
        "Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use multiple agents to work together and accomplish a task which requires finding info from the web and coding. `AssistantAgent` is an LLM-based agent that can write and debug Python code (in a Python coding block) for a user to execute for a given task. `UserProxyAgent` is an agent which serves as a proxy for a user to execute the code written by `AssistantAgent`. We further create a planning agent for the assistant agent to consult. The planning agent is a variation of the LLM-based `AssistantAgent` with a different system message.\n",

        "AutoGen requires `Python>=3.8`. To run this notebook example, please install pyautogen and docker:\n",

            "2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Once you have the trending topics, you can perform sentiment analysis on them to understand the context and sentiment. There are several Python libraries like TextBlob, NLTK, etc., that can be used for sentiment analysis.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Generating Prompts**: Based on the sentiment and context, you can generate prompts. This could be a simple rule-based system or you could use more advanced techniques like Natural Language Processing (NLP).\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Sending Prompts to Discord Bot**: Discord provides a bot API that can be used to send messages (prompts in this case) to a Discord server. You would need to create a bot on the Discord developer portal and use the bot token in your script to authenticate and send messages.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Upgrading and Downloading Images**: If by \"upgrading\" you mean applying some sort of filter or effect to the images, there are several Python libraries like Pillow, OpenCV, etc., that can be used for image processing. Once the image is processed, you can use the `requests` library to download the image.\n",
            "\n",
            "Please note that this is a complex task and requires a good understanding of Python programming, APIs, and possibly NLP. Also, each social media platform has its own rules and limitations for using their APIs, so you would need to check their documentation for details.\n",
